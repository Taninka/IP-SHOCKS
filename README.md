# IP-SHOCKS
Case study of IP shocks

Two main codes for preprocessing and analysis of IP shocks
- 2cme_run.py (execute the following code)
- 2cme_exectute.py

SI_slope_statistics.py computes different statistical relationship of SI slope (derivative in SYM-H index) with paramters of solar wind upstream.

cda_data_download.py download Data from NASA CDA web which serves as a public database from current and past space missions operated by NASA.

read_all_magnetograms.py create final magnetogram for dates of IP shocks.

special_graphs.py generate special graphs for IP shock analysis.
